# PE2

This is Project Euler #2 solution. I never worked with a Fibonacci sequence problem before, and it was pretty interesting. I autopopulated the first few values in the list because I couldn't think of how to start it otherwise. 

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
